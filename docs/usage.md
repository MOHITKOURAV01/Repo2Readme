# Usage

`repo2readme` has two commands: `run` (generate a README) and `reset` (clear saved API keys).

## Generate a README from a GitHub repo

```bash
repo2readme run --url https://github.com/agsaru/repo2readme -o README_NEW.md
```

## Generate a README from a local repo

```bash
repo2readme run --local ./path/to/your/repo -o README_LOCAL.md
```

If you don't pass `-o`, the output defaults to `README.md` in your current directory.

## Preview before spending tokens

Every `run` estimates token usage and file count before making any API calls, and asks for confirmation:

```
Repository Analysis

Files to summarize : 45
Estimated tokens   : ~120,000
Request size       : ~420.5 KB

Proceed? [y/N]
```

Pass `--force` to skip this prompt and overwrite the output file automatically.

To check what *would* happen without using any API calls or requiring keys at all, use `--dry-run` — see [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md#--dry-run) for details.

## The repository tree

`--dry-run` prints a tree, and the same tree is embedded in the generated README
as the **Folder Structure** section:

```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── routes.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── util.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.py
└── README.md
```

It is built from the files that were actually loaded, so it always lists exactly
what was analyzed — anything removed by `--exclude`, `--max-file-size-kb`,
`--respect-gitignore` or the default ignore rules is absent from the tree too,
and anything pulled back in with `--include` appears.

Very large repositories are truncated so the tree does not dominate the prompt:
at most 8 levels deep and 50 entries per directory. Truncation is always
visible, never silent:

```
├── generated/
│   └── ... (1,204 more, depth limit reached)
└── ... (37 more)
```

## The Dependency Overview

For Python, JavaScript and TypeScript files, imports are resolved into a graph
and a short summary of it is handed to the model along with the file summaries:

```markdown
### Core Modules
Files most depended on by other modules:
- `auth/index.ts` (2 incoming dependencies)
- `billing/index.ts` (2 incoming dependencies)

### Entry Points
Files that import others but are not imported themselves:
- `auth/routes.ts`
```

Two things about how it reads:

- **Names are disambiguated, not truncated.** A file whose basename is unique
  among the listed files renders as just that basename; one that collides grows
  by as many leading directories as it takes to be unique.
- **Entry points import something.** A file that imports nothing and is
  imported by nothing is *isolated*, and is counted separately in the
  statistics. The two buckets never overlap.

The block is stable: the same repository produces the same overview on every
run, so a regenerated README differs only where the repository actually did.

## Filtering files

By default, common non-essential files (`.git`, `node_modules`, lock files, images, archives, etc.) are skipped. You can adjust this with `--include` / `--exclude` / `--max-file-size-kb` — see [Configuration](./configuration.md) and the [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md).

## Filter using `.gitignore`

Use `--respect-gitignore` to honor `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude` rules while scanning a repository. This is opt-in, so the default behavior remains unchanged.

```bash
repo2readme run --local ./repo --respect-gitignore
repo2readme run --url https://github.com/user/repo --respect-gitignore
```

## Clear stored API keys

```bash
repo2readme reset
```
