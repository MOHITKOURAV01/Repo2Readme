"""Gitignore support for repository traversal.

``is_gitignored`` used to reload and recompile the ignore rules on every call:
it opened ``.gitignore``, opened ``.git/info/exclude`` and asked ``pathspec``
to compile every pattern into a regex, once per path. Traversal asks about
every directory and every file, so a 400-file repository opened and compiled
the same file 420 times, and the cost grew with the length of ``.gitignore``.

Rules are now compiled once per directory and cached for the life of the
process, keyed on each file's modification time and size so a long-running
caller cannot serve stale rules.

Only the repository root was consulted, too. Git applies a ``.gitignore`` in
any directory to that directory's subtree, which is how a JavaScript project
keeps ``frontend/build/`` out of the repository - and generated bundles are
exactly the files that waste the most tokens. Every level from the root down to
the path being tested is now consulted, in git's order.

Deliberately not supported: ``core.excludesFile``. A per-machine ignore list
would make the same repository produce a different README on a different
machine.
